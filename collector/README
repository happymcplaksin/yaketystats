Ruby collector for YS.

The bad news: you need ruby 1.9.2 and this patch set:
https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/1c9f703a4705b75a31308682828a57330422c706
The files from that patch set are included in the ext/ directory.

If you want to write your own ruby-based plugins, here's what you
need to know:

etc/plugins.d/PLUGIN-NAME.y
    The config file for your plugin. See the existing ones for
    examples.

plugins.d/PLUGIN-NAME.rb
    The actual plugin code. This file should contain a class that is
    named the same thing as the file (minus the .rb of course.) This
    class should include YS::Plugin and should have at least three
    methods:
        #initialize(options)
            Collector will initialize your plugin with the options
            hash from the .y yaml file. Even if your plugin has no
            options, please follow the convention.

            This function should also call 'self.interval=' and set
            the interval to something sane.

        #go
            This function does the bulk of the work required to
            get data. No use is made of its returned value.

        #stats
            This function returns a string containing all of the
            stats returned by this plugin. Ideally it does little or
            no processing beyond formatting this string.

        #monitor
            Future-use up/down/nagios style monitoring.

External scripts can either send their stats strings into run/bucket,
or be run via the 'plugout' method.
