In here you'll find example .y files for plugins that we ship but
that you don't necessarily want enabled on day one.

Note that the .y file's name doesn't have to match the plugin's
name. Keep in mind that you can have multiple instances of a given
plugin. These all match just to make it easy on the reader.
