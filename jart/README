Jart is the Javascript Asynchronous RRD Tool. Jart was developed by
the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia as part of
the YacketyStats package.

Requirements:

   1. PHP4/PHP5 and a web server
      1. I don't believe there are any minor version requirements
         for PHP4. If you're running something reasonable, it will
         almost certainly work.

      2. PHP must also have the ability to write files in some
         directories below the install directory.

         * Jart was written and has been tested with Debian Sarge's
           Apache-SSL/PHP4 and a pristine php.ini. If your php.ini
           differs, some changes may be required. Documentation
           patches are welcome.

   2. RRDTool 1.2.23 or newer
   3. Firefox or a derivative.
      1. There is currently no support for IE, Opera,
         Konqeror/Mac-browser. Feel free to submit patches.

Installing:

Unpack the tarball and edit the variables in conf.php-dist to match
your installation. Save this edited file as conf.php. Change modes
or ownership of the 'graphs' and 'playlists' subdirectories to allow
your PHP installation to write to them.
