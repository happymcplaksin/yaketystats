Jart is the Javascript Asynchronous RRD Tool. Jart was developed by
the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia as part of
the YacketyStats package.

Requirements:

   1. PHP4/PHP5 and a web server
      1. I don't believe there are any minor version requirements
         for PHP4. If you're running something reasonable, it will
         almost certainly work.

      2. PHP must also have the ability to write files in some
         directories below the install directory.

         * Jart was written and has been tested with Debian Sarge's
           Apache-SSL/PHP4 and a pristine php.ini. If your php.ini
           differs, some changes may be required. Documentation
           patches are welcome.

   2. RRDTool 1.3 or newer
   3. Firefox or a derivative.
      1. There is currently no support for IE, Opera,
         Konqeror/Mac-browser. Feel free to submit patches.

Installing:

Jart requires Apache simple auth. Here's an example:

<pre>
<Files "*">
  Authtype Basic
  AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/htpass
  AuthName "Jart"
  require user sam happy 
</Files>

<FilesMatch "^store.php$|^maintenance$">
  Allow from .mydomain.com
  Satisfy any
</FilesMatch>
</pre>

[[Download]] Jart.

Install Jart's files into your web tree. Copy the example config file and edit it:

<pre>
$ cp conf.php{-dist,}
$ vi conf.php
</pre>

* Make sure that the font pointed to actually exists. 
* Add any users to the list of admins that you want to be able to debug problems.
* Set the value of $rrddir to the directory containing YaketyStats-created RRD files.
* Allow the webserver user to write to graphs/ and playlists:

<pre>
# chown apache:apache graphs playlists
</pre>

This example assumes that 'apache' is the correct user. Debian derivatives use 'www-data' and your system may use something else entirely.

You should now be able to use Jart!
