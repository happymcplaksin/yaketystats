YaketyStats (aka YS) gathers statistics about your *nix systems. YS is easy to install, configure and maintain.

YS also has an AJAX-powered web interface for graphing data in RRD files--including Google Maps-like dragging.

YS was created out of frustration with the difficulty of installing, configuring and extending existing statistical analysis packages. Our goal was to create a package that was not only easy to use, but also easy to extend to track anything you want with as little hassle as possible.
